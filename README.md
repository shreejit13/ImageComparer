# ImageComparer

Compare images on you laptop irrespective of image extension and get comparison score based on pixel to pixel comparison.

## Algorithm Used

ImageComparer works on simple logic of breaking down images into the smallest units(pixel) and then compares each pixel at same location in corresponding images. Based on the number of pixels matching out of total pixel, it then generates a score for the level of match between images.
